THE END IS THE BEGINNING
#
Changing position:

object.goto(x, y)

If you don't use the penup() method, the turtle will go to the desired position, but will draw while going there.



#
Speed:

object.speed(integer_value_from_1_to_10)

If the speed is greater than 10 or less than 0.5, the speed becomes 0. 0 means that there'll be no animation. The turtle is going to move instantly.



#
Turning by angles:

Turn by degrees.

object.setheading(degrees)

On standard mode:
0 - east
90 - north
180 - west
270 - south



#
Pen up and pen down:

It's used to move the cursor without drawing on the screen.

object.penup()
object.pendown()



#
Colors:

*
Changing the outline color:

object.color('color_name')

Hex values are also accepted.



*
Chaging the background color:

turtle.bgcolor('color_name')

This one has to be turtle instead of the instantiated object, otherwise the backgorund color will not be changed.



*
Inside color:

These two methods are used to fill a geometrical shape with a color. The begin_fill goes before all the orders to move, and the end_fill goes after all orders.

...
object.begin_fill()
for _ in range(4):
    object.forward(100)
    object.right(90)
object.end_fill()
...

The color is filled automatically with the outline color, but if you want to change that, simply add another argument with the color you want in the color() method.

Example:
...
ron.color('blue', 'cyan')  # The first color is for the outline, the second is for the filling

ron.begin_fill()
for _ in range(4):
    ron.left(90)
    ron.forward(100)
ron.end_fill()
...



#
Directions:

object.forward(pixels)
object.back(pixels)
object.left(degrees) 
object.right(degrees)



#
Creating a drawing object:

This will create the object that will do the drawing.

Example:
import turtle
bob = turtle.Turtle()
turtle.done()



#
Ending the program:

It's important to always end your turtle programs with turtle.done(). This keeps the screen open. You can already make a window appear by using this command.
