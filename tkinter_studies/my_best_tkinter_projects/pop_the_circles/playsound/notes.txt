I'll try to learn how to add sounds to tkinter.

#
1.
First, create a window and initialize pygame:
```
import pygame
import tkinter as tk

# Initializing pygame
pygame.mixer.init()

window = tk.Tk()


window.mainloop()
```

2.
Create a function to play the sound. You'll need to load the sound, and then play it. This is the funciton:
```
def play():
    pygame.mixer.music.load("duck.mp3")
    pygame.mixer.music.play(loops=0)
```

Remember that the sound should be in the same folder, or you'll have to type the full path to the file.

3.
Create a button and assign the function to it:
```
b = tk.Button(window, text="Quack", font=("times new roman", 50, "bold"), command=play)
b.pack(expand=True)
```
