When the key is pressed, the name of the chord should
appear on the screen.

DONE: Work on the change_label function. Maybe it's good to change
the name of the chord files. This will help with expansion, if
I ever intend to add more keys to the program. If you do it,
you'll have to change the code for all of the files written so far.
Maybe it's worth it.
