If you want to add the item to the end, simple type END on the index when you're inserting a new item.

Adding a list of items to the listbox:
```
my_list = ["one", "two", "three"]
for item in my_list:
    my_listbox.insert("end", item)
```

Remember that the listbox is like a python list, so its index starts at 0.
