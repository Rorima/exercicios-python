"""
Purpose: display a random list of chords to the user.
OBS: The chords are in Roman numerals (search for functional harmony).

How I use this:
I choose a key that I'm learning and I play the chords the program
tells me to. I do this until I learn the key, which takes less than 10
minutes, but I keep on practicing the same key for a week (10 minutes a day)
until I really have it down. When I finish my study, I choose another key
and repeat the process. I learn all keys on the ukulele using this program
and this method.
