By definition, a closure is a nested function that references one or more variables from its enclosing scope. A closure only happens in a nested function.

Example of a closure:

def say():
    greeting = 'Hello'

    def display():
        print(greeting)

    display()


By default, a free variable, i.e. a variable from the enclosing scope, is read only, and can't be modified, except when explicitly stated by the keyword nonlocal.
