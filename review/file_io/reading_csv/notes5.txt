What is a CSV file:
A CSV file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. It consists of one or more lines. Each line is a data record. And each data record consists of one or more values separated by commas. In addition, all the lines of a CSV file have the same number of values. Typically, you use a csv file to store tabular data in plain text.



Read CSV file:

First, import the csv module:
```
import csv
```

Second, open the csv file. If it contains UTF-8 characters, you need to specify the encoding:
```
f = open ('path/to/csv_file', encoding='UTF8')
```

Third, pass the file object (f) to the reader() function of the csv module. The reader() function returns a csv reader object:
```
csv_reader = csv.reader(f)
```

The csv_reader is an iterable object of lines from the CVS file. Therefore, you can iterate over the lines of the csv file using a for loop. Each line is a list of values.
```
for line in csv_reader:
    print(line)
```

Finally, don't forget to close the file:
```
f.close()
```

Complete code:

```
import csv

with open("countries.csv", 'r') as f:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(f)
    counter = 0
    for line in csv_reader:
        counter += 1
        print(f"Line: {counter}:", line)
```

Reading a CSV file using the DictReader class:
The DictReader class allows you to create an object like a regular CSV reader. But it maps the information of each line to a dictionary whose keys are specified by the values of the first line.

By using the DictReader class, you can access values in the country.csv file like line['name'], line ['area'], line['country_code2'], and line ['country_code3'].

Ex.:
```
from csv import DictReader

with open("countries.csv") as f:
    csv_reader = DictReader(f)
    for line in csv_reader:
        print(f"Country: {line['Country']}")
        print(f"Language: {line['Language']}")
        print(f"Food: {line['Food']}")
        print()
```



*
Fieldnames:

If you want to have different field names other than the ones specified in the first line, you can explicitly specify them by passing a list of field names to the DictReader() constructor like this:

```
import csv

fieldnames = ['cntry', 'lang', 'fd']

with open('countries.csv') as f:
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(f, fieldnames)
    next(csv_reader)
    for line in csv_reader:
        print(f"Country: {line['cntry']};")
        print(f"Language: {line['lang']};")
        print(f"Food: {line['fd']};")
        print()
```
