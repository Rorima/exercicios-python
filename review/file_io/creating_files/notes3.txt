Create a text file:
You can open the file using the 'w' mode. If the file doesn't exist, the open() function creates a new file. Otherwise, it'll overwrite the contesnts of the existing file.

'x' - open a file for exclusive creation. If the file exists, the open() function raises an error (FileExistsError). Otherwise, it'll create the file.
