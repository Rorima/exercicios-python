Create a program that tests the user on chess table square colors. The user has to figure out if the color of that particular square is white or black.

Create an algorithm to assign the colors to the coordinates and then test the user.

At the end of the program, show a score. Show how many the user got right, how many they got wrong, and an option to show which ones the user got wrong.
